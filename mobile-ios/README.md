# DailyBrief iOS

This directory hosts two SwiftPM packages:

- `Package.swift` – defines the reusable **Core** library that owns networking and domain types.
- `MyApp.swiftpm` – holds the SwiftUI application wrapper generated by Xcode. It depends on the Core library.

## Testing

Host-platform logic:
```bash
cd mobile-ios
swift test
```

iOS-simulator tests:
```bash
cd mobile-ios
xcodebuild -list           # discover available schemes such as "Core"
xcodebuild -scheme Core test -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=latest,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
```

CI pipelines should run both `swift test` (for Foundation-only code) and `xcodebuild test` (for simulator coverage). Keep secrets and signing identities out of source control.

## App package

The SwiftUI app now lives under `MyApp.swiftpm`. Open that directory in Xcode (File → Open Package...) to edit UI code or run the app. To integrate the Kotlin shared framework, continue following the instructions in `mobile-android/shared`.
